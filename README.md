Simple bot for listening Flowdock flows.

Currently depends on improvements branch of my own [clj-flowdock repo](https://github.com/pixell/clj-flowdock.git).

Inspired by a presentation of [Erik Assum in clojuTRE 2014](http://clojutre.org/2014/#erik), which included [mybot](https://github.com/slipset/mybot).
